    textResponse: Dingo was the captain of the Austrodyum Prime. He appears to be
      missing his signature cowboy hat and glasses. After some detective work, you
      realize that this is because he has actually been crudely decapitated, so it
      would be somewhat difficult to continue wearing a hat. You also conclude that
      this was likely the cause of death.

    textResponse: You give captain Dingo's cowboy boots a good old lick, and your
      salty tears mingle with the leathery taste. It seems you serve this great man
      in death much in the same way you did in life.

    textResponse: You put Dingo in your backpack. You stop briefly to wonder how
      you managed that, but you decide not to think too much about it.
