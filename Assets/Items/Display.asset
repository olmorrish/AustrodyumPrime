    textResponse: You take a long, hard look at the display. The holographic projections
      responds to touch, and by using it you may be able to access the ship's database.
      The display says it needs a retinal scan from the captain to access. This strikes
      you as odd, since the captain always wears sunglasses - he never took them
      off.

    textResponse: 'You attempt to lick the display, but it''s just a holographic
      projection. You taste nothing but air, disappointment, and the fear of failure
      that your upbringing instilled in you. It''s been a long ride to get here. '
