    textResponse: This type of console is typically used to project 3D images of
      ships for combat visualizations. However, this is an animal cargo ship, and
      so the hologram is less combat-oriented. A 3D model of a penguin - static in
      its pose - bounces and spins around the range of the holotable, tumbling around
      like a screensaver icon.
