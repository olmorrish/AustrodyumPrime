    textResponse: Built to comemorate the creation of the penguin-shipping craft,
      the katana isn't built for combat, though it'll do in a pinch. It has an ornate
      handle wrapped with silver cloth. The logo of the Austrodyum Prime - a penguin
      with a crown - has been laser-etched into the flat of the blade.

    textResponse: You lick the sharp edge of the blade, like an absolute bufoon.
      A metalic taste floods your mouth, but it's not from the steel of the blade.

    textResponse: You put the katana in your backpack. It cuts right through the
      bottom, because it's a backpack, not a sheathe. It'll have to do.
