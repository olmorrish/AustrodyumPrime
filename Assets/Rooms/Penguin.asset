  description: 'The console comes to life, the glowing words of the last captain''s
    log float in the air: "ALL CREW PRESUMED DEAD - CARGO HAS STAGED A COUP - GOING
    DOWN WITH THE SHIP - YEEHAW" . The door opens behind you. A lone penguin stands
    there, between you and the door. The small creature, reaching barely as high
    as your knees, is wearing a cowboy hat, and it''s eyes are obscured by dark sunglasses.
    It holds a revolver, which is pointed directly at your torso. You wonder if anything
    in your backpack might get you out of this bizarre scenario.'
