  description: 'A lone penguin stands between you and the door. The small creature,
    reaching barely as high as your knees, is wearing captain a cowboy hat, and it''s
    small beady eyes are obscured by dark sunglasses. It holds a revolver, which
    is pointed directly at your torso. You wonder if anything in your backpack might
    get you out of this bizarre scenario. '
