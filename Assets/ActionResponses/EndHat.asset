  endText: In the darkness of space, you know that a small connection goes a long
    way. The hat on your head, you sit cross legged in front of the little bird,
    remaining calm. You've bonded over less. You and this creature are the same.
    Warm blooded beings, in space, with hats. But the penguin knows that you cannot
    be allowed to live. Hats or not, you are different, and space is harsh, unfair,
    and always cold...
